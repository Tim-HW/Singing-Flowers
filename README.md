# Murailles

“Murailles” (Walls from stronghold) is an attempt to get desert plants known as Rose of Jericho to play modal music. called Rose of Jericho. These prehistoric ferns have the peculiarity 
movements visible to the naked eye when in contact with water. This project has been acheived using camera and basic computer vision tools such as OpenCV.the plant quartet can make music almost autonomously. 
This work aims to facilitate the perception of a discreet but extremely touching phenomenon such as the movement of these plants, which are themselves little-known. 
The plants will be present in the exhibition alongside the video of their performance. Sheet music is available so that anyone can play the composition made by the plants.
